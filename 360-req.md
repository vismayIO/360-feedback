### 4.6 Module: Score Calculation

#### 4.6.1 Description

Calculate final 360 score from colleague ratings using simple average (all reviewers have equal weight).

#### 4.6.2 Requirements

| ID      | Requirement                                                  | Priority    |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| CALC-01 | Self-rating shall be EXCLUDED from final score               | Must Have   |
| CALC-02 | System shall calculate simple average of colleague ratings   | Must Have   |
| CALC-03 | All reviewer types shall have equal weight (1.0x)            | Must Have   |
| CALC-04 | System shall map final score to 4-point label                | Must Have   |
| CALC-05 | System shall calculate competency-wise scores                | Must Have   |
| CALC-06 | System shall calculate reviewer-category-wise scores         | Must Have   |
| CALC-07 | Calculation shall trigger when cycle moves to COMPLETED      | Must Have   |

#### 4.6.3 Calculation Formula

```
Final Score = Sum of all reviewer average ratings / Total number of reviewers

Where:
- Each reviewer's rating = Average of their responses across all questions
- All reviewers have equal weight (1.0x)

Example:
- Manager: avg rating 3
- Peer 1: avg rating 4
- Peer 2: avg rating 3
- Direct Report: avg rating 4

Final Score = (3 + 4 + 3 + 4) / 4
            = 14 / 4
            = 3.5 → Round to 4 → "Outstanding Impact"
```
